------------------------------------------------------------------------What have we made (Amr and yasser)------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#Note: when I say ( page ) I mean html and css files.

1- home page (before the sign up and login) (you can modify the design to make it better if you want)
2- sign up page (don't touch it)
3- log in page (don't touch it)
4- show recipes page (it is a list of available recipes) --- (no done yet , anyone can compelete it now and fix it's design to get it done) and take care you should make alot fo icons like a star (to add the recipe to favorite page) and a bin (to delete the recipe) and a pen (to edit recipe)


#Note : 1- (and do not care with the functionality of them right now cause in this phase (1) we only need to make HTML and CSS we don't need to apply JS now)
        2- (I made a JS code in the HTML file (index -> home page) to check if you have signed up or logged in or not , so take care please)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------what do we need more ?????----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#Note: when I say ( page ) I mean html and css files.

5- compelete show recipes page (number 4 above)
6- make a page for Admin and apply his features (read the assignment document above)
7- make a page for normal user and apply his features (read the assignment document above)
8- make a favorite recipes page 
9- make a page like a profile for the user to show him the name and the his credentials on the website and to let him see his favorite recipes


That's everything, and please take care of the design for each page cause may be there is extral bonus on the good-looking websites (projects) and again don't care about the functionality or JS right now , focus only on the design.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------Who should make what ?????---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#Note : look at the number above

I suggest : Mario works on 4 and 5
            Mohamed works on 6
            Sherif works on 7 and 8 
            yahia works on 9
            
#Knowing that (me and yasser) will help anyone in making his page and I will conect every page with the other ones and fix any design to make it better.



#Thank you.
